# Python-Data-Types

## Objective Statement
- To get insight into the sequence(list, tupple) data types in python
- To get insight into dataset types in python
- To get insight into dictionary data types in python
- To get insight into the functions and methods used in sequence data types
- To get insight into the functions and methods used in data sets and dictionaries
- To get insight into indexing as well as slicing on sequence data types
## Challenges
- Syntax in python is case sensitive
- Some data types cannot be indexed or sliced
## Methodology
- Functions and methods on a list
- Functions and methods on tupple
- Functions and methods on set
- Functions and methods in the dictionary
- Indexing and Slicing on sequence data types
## Benefit
- Knowing the various functions and methods that will be applied to each data type used
- Knowing the implementation of functions and methods that are applied to each data type
## Expected Outcome
- Know how to create sequence data types
- Know how to create data types sets and dictionaries
- Knowing the functions and methods used in sequence data types (list, tupple)
- Knowing the functions and methods used in data set types and also dictionaries
- Knowing the implementation of the use of functions and methods for each data type
- Knowing the implementation of indexing and slicing on sequence data types
